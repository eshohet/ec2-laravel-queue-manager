EC2 Queue Manager for Laravel

Place the cron.config file inside of your .ebextensions folder in the root of your project.
This file will create a shell script at the direct "/tmp" on your ec2 instances.
It will also create a cronjob that is ran by root.

This cronjob will automatically switch to the webapp user and then run the manager.sh script.
The manager.sh script checks for a file called "queue_pid" in /tmp.
If it finds that file, it will check /proc/pid/cmdline to make sure that the command:
php /var/www/html/artisan queue:listen is actually being ran.

If that is not the case, it will spawn up a new process and write it's pid to queue_pid.
